# Plotly-Challenge

You can view the interactive dashboard for this challenge here: https://danacw.github.io/Bellybutton-Study-Interactive-Dashboard/ 

For this challenge, I used Plotly's JavaScript graphing library and the D3 JavaScript library to create a dynamic, interactive dashboard on data from North Carolina State's <a href=http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/> Belly Button Biodiversity Study </href> </a>. The user has the ability to select specific test subject's ID to view data on each participant.

<b> data </b>
- contains my samples.json file of data used in the analysis.

<b> static / js </b>
- contains my app.js file used to create each graph and add interactivity to the page.
